    "text": "The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.\nThis data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the code folders.\nYou should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and not edit it. Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

Document somewhere what inputs each script takes and where output is placed.\nIf scripts need to be run in a specific order, document this.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Pooja/Pooja/Spring 2025/EPID-BIOS-8060E-MADA/PoojaGokhale-MADA-Portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

For model 2, ROC-AUC = 0.98, thus it is excellent at distinguishing between the sexes.\nExercise 10: Model Improvement\nRemove the variable race:\n\ndrug_mag_final$RACE &lt;- NULL\n\nWe now have a dataset with 120 observations and 6 variables.\nNow, we set a random seed for reproducibility\n\nrngseed = 1234\n\nNow, we split the data - 75% train and 25% test set:\n\n# Load the rsample package (part of tidymodels)\nlibrary(rsample)\n\n# Set the seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(rngseed)\n\n# Split the data into 75% train and 25% test\ndata_split &lt;- initial_split(drug_mag_final, prop = 3/4)\n\n# Create data frames for the two sets\ntrain_data &lt;- training(data_split)  # 75% training set\ntest_data  &lt;- testing(data_split)   # 25% test set\n\nNow, we fit two models to the training data:\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\n── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels 1.2.0 ──\n\n\n✔ broom        1.0.6      ✔ recipes      1.0.10\n✔ dials        1.3.0      ✔ tibble       3.2.1 \n✔ infer        1.0.7      ✔ tune         1.2.1 \n✔ modeldata    1.4.0      ✔ workflows    1.1.4 \n✔ parsnip      1.2.1      ✔ workflowsets 1.1.0 \n✔ purrr        1.0.2      ✔ yardstick    1.3.1 \n\n\n── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels_conflicts() ──\n✖ purrr::discard()         masks scales::discard()\n✖ dplyr::filter()          masks stats::filter()\n✖ kableExtra::group_rows() masks dplyr::group_rows()\n✖ dplyr::lag()             masks stats::lag()\n✖ recipes::step()          masks stats::step()\n• Dig deeper into tidy modeling with R at https://www.tmwr.org\n\n# Model 1: Only DOSE\ndose_only_model &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;%\n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;%\n  fit(Y ~ DOSE, data = train_data)\n\ndose_only_predictions &lt;- predict(dose_only_model, new_data = train_data) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(train_data)\n\ndose_only_rmse &lt;- dose_only_predictions %&gt;%\n  rmse(truth = Y, estimate = .pred)\n\n# Model 2: All predictors\nfull_predictors_model &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;%\n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;%\n  fit(Y ~ DOSE + HT + WT + AGE + as.factor(SEX), data = train_data)\n\nfull_predictors_predictions &lt;- predict(full_predictors_model, new_data = train_data) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(train_data)\n\nfull_predictors_rmse &lt;- full_predictors_predictions %&gt;%\n  rmse(truth = Y, estimate = .pred)\n\n# Null Model\nnull_model &lt;- null_model() %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"parsnip\") %&gt;%\n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;%\n  fit(Y ~ 1, data = train_data)\n\nnull_predictions &lt;- predict(null_model, new_data = train_data) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(train_data)\n\nnull_rmse &lt;- null_predictions %&gt;%\n  rmse(truth = Y, estimate = .pred)\n\n# Print all RMSE results in the desired order\ncat(\"DOSE-only Model RMSE:\", dose_only_rmse$.estimate, \"\\n\")\n\nDOSE-only Model RMSE: 702.8078 \n\ncat(\"Full Predictors Model RMSE:\", full_predictors_rmse$.estimate, \"\\n\")\n\nFull Predictors Model RMSE: 627.4408 \n\ncat(\"Null Model RMSE:\", null_rmse$.estimate, \"\\n\")\n\nNull Model RMSE: 948.3526 \n\n\nWe see that the highest RMSE value is observed with the null model, followed by the dose-only model, followed by the model using all the predictors.

Thus we can remove this variable. Similarly, we can see that this is national level data, and geographic_name and geographic_level are the same - “National”. As such, we can remove geographic_name from the dataset. The suppression_flag variable is the same - 0 - for all, and thus does not provide any additional useful information and can thus be removed. The number of weighted individuals have 420 NAs. The dataset has 505 variables, of which a sizable amount are NA. Removing all the NAs would leave us with a very small dataset.

Those that received a vaccination increased from less than 10% in September to over 20% in December.\n\nThis part was contributed by Doreen Kibuule Kalembe.\nI used the AI tools to prompt it to write code that can generate an R script to create a synthetic COVID-19 dataset with at least 100 observations. The dataset should include columns for vaccine type, geographical level, demographic name, indicator category labels, month, weighted estimates, and unweighted responses. Looking at the final dataset used for annalysis, I went with the 100 observations though the final data set had only 68 observations\n\nset.seed(123)  # For reproducibility\n\n# Generate 100 observations\ndata_size &lt;- 100\n\n# Define possible values for categorical variables\nvaccine &lt;- rep(\"COVID\", data_size)\ngeographical_level &lt;- rep(\"National\", data_size)\ndemographic_name &lt;- rep(\"18+ year olds\", data_size)\nindicator_category_label &lt;- sample(c(\"Definitely or probably will get a vaccine\", \n                                     \"Definitely will get a vaccine\", \n                                     \"Probably will get a vaccine\", \n                                     \"Received vaccination\"), \n                                   data_size, replace = TRUE)\nmonth &lt;- sample(c(\"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\"), \n                data_size, replace = TRUE)\n\n# Generate continuous variables\nnd_weekly_estimate &lt;- runif(data_size, min = 9, max = 50)  # Weighted estimate\nunweighted_response &lt;- sample(1000:300000, data_size, replace = TRUE)  # Unweighted response count\n\n# Create data frame\ncovid_data &lt;- data.frame(vaccine, geographical_level, demographic_name, \n                         indicator_category_label, month, \n                         nd_weekly_estimate, unweighted_response)\n\n# Display first few rows\nhead(covid_data)\n\n  vaccine geographical_level demographic_name      indicator_category_label\n1   COVID           National    18+ year olds   Probably will get a vaccine\n2   COVID           National    18+ year olds   Probably will get a vaccine\n3   COVID           National    18+ year olds   Probably will get a vaccine\n4   COVID           National    18+ year olds Definitely will get a vaccine\n5   COVID           National    18+ year olds   Probably will get a vaccine\n6   COVID           National    18+ year olds Definitely will get a vaccine\n     month nd_weekly_estimate unweighted_response\n1   August           40.10232              116945\n2 November           14.62135              217026\n3   August           25.25997              183562\n4   August           18.22440              278846\n5  October           11.37630              138694\n6 November           25.23160              169840\n\n# Save as CSV\nwrite.csv(covid_data, \"synthetic_covid_data.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\nlets try to look at the monthly distributions of those who received the vaccine.\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(here)\nsynthetic_covid_data&lt;-read_csv(\"synthetic_covid_data.csv\")\n\nRows: 100 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (5): vaccine, geographical_level, demographic_name, indicator_category_l...\ndbl (2): nd_weekly_estimate, unweighted_response\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\nsummary(synthetic_covid_data)\n\n   vaccine          geographical_level demographic_name  \n Length:100         Length:100         Length:100        \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n indicator_category_label    month           nd_weekly_estimate\n Length:100               Length:100         Min.   : 9.337    \n Class :character         Class :character   1st Qu.:18.227    \n Mode  :character         Mode  :character   Median :26.923    \n                                             Mean   :28.593    \n                                             3rd Qu.:39.969    \n                                             Max.   :49.976    \n unweighted_response\n Min.   :  2497     \n 1st Qu.:104954     \n Median :170088     \n Mean   :164745     \n 3rd Qu.:238216     \n Max.   :295245     \n\n#Look at month distribution\ntable(synthetic_covid_data$month)\n\n\n   August  December  November   October September \n       19        23        19        20        19 \n\n#Summary by month\n#September\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Filter data for September and then summarize by indicator_category_label\nseptember_summary &lt;- synthetic_covid_data |&gt;\n  filter(month == \"September\") |&gt;\n  group_by(indicator_category_label) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n       mean_value = mean(nd_weekly_estimate, na.rm = TRUE),\n    sd_value = sd(nd_weekly_estimate, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = 'drop'  # Removes the grouping structure after summarization\n  )\n\n# View the summary for September\nseptember_summary\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  indicator_category_label                  mean_value sd_value\n  &lt;chr&gt;

We still see that individuals who won’t get a vaccine have a higher percentage than others.\nI strongly believe this synthetic data can help us mirror what might happen for the real data."

The R-squared is 0.005176. Thus, while infant mortality is a useful predictor, this model is not able to explain a large potion of the variability in the life expectancy, and other variables should be considered.\nFor the second model (using population), the p-value for population is greater than 0.05, thus we can conclude that population is not a useful predictor of life expectancy.\nhelp(movielens)"

Whichever approach you choose, add ample documentation/commentary so you and others can easily understand what’s going on and what is done."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Pooja/Pooja/Spring 2025/EPID-BIOS-8060E-MADA/PoojaGokhale-MADA-Portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."
